This is a very important property in drug development: if a proposed drug isn't soluble enough, you probably won't be able to get enough into the patient's bloodstream to have a therapeutic effect.  The first thing we need is a data set of measured solubilities for real molecules.  One of the core components of DeepChem is MoleculeNet, a diverse collection of chemical and molecular data sets.
